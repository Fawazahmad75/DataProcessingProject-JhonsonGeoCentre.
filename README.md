# DataProcessingProject-JhonsonGeoCentre.
Developed a comprehensive data visualization and interactive dashboard for the "Our Future & Space" exhibit at the Johnson Geo Centre at Memorial University.
Utilized Python and Pandas to process and analyze satellite data from the General Catalog of Artificial Space Objects (GCAT). Created an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly, allowing users to explore satellite data trends and insights. Designed an infographic poster showcasing key stories and patterns in the data for public display at the exhibit.
Ensured visual clarity and aesthetic appeal using Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations.
